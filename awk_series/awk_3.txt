# Make sure to check which version of awk you are using. I wrote this based on
# documentation for gawk, which is the default awk on my Ubuntu system, but my
# Linux Mint distro uses mawk.
awk --version

# If you have gawk version 5.3 or later, then you can use --csv

# Nothing will print because the fields are expected to be separated by spaces
awk '{ print $7 }' test.txt

# we can see that there are only 5 fields right now
awk '{ print NF }' test.txt

# but we can change the field separator with variables
awk -v FS="," '{ print NF }' test.txt

# but we expect there to be 7. Awk isn't handling the quotes as we would hope.
# Let's fix that by defining what is a Field, instead of what isn't a field.
# we can start by replicating what we are already doing.
awk -v FPAT="[^,]+" '{ print NF }' test.txt

# now we can add in something to handle the quotes
awk -v FPAT="([^,]+)|(\"[^\"]+\")" '{ print NF }' test.txt
