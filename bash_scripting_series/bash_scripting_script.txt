# use echo to make things appear on screen
echo "Hello"

# if we just try to use the escape code, it doesn't work
echo "\033[33mHello"

# we need to use the -e flag for echo
echo -e "\033[33mHello"

# we can stack flags into our output stream, so let's create a brighter yellow
echo -e "\033[1;33mHello"

# we can have multiple colors from the same output
echo -e "\033[33mHello \033[34mWorld"

# and we can make the second color bright
echo -e "\033[33mHello \033[1;34mWorld"

# but if we try to make the first one bright..
echo -e "\033[1;33mHello \033[34mWorld"

# So, when we go to define the colors, we want to be aware if we want the bright
# flag on or off.
echo -e "\033[1;33mHello \033[0;34mWorld"

# there are other font modifiers, but be aware that they all don't work on all
# machines. What works on my machine is underline and invert colors
echo -e "\033[4;33mHello \033[7;34mWorld \033[0m"

# on another machine, I got other codes to work, so try it out for your self.
