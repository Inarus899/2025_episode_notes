note that the p1 - p6 files were my outline, but the video might have different
words here and there, since it was done "live".

The actual video ended with the index.html file in this directory, as well as
the php file.

Remember to make sure the tasklist.txt file exists, is owned by root, and has
the right permissions, which can be set with:
sudo chmod 666 tasklist.txt
