# rather large install
sudo apt install npm

# create a directory and make the app
mkdir react
cd react

# create the framework for an app
npm create vite@latest

# the previous step tells us what to do, so we will do that
cd todo
npm install
npm run dev

# note the npm run dev does not make the site available to other users on the
# network. It does have this little hint that says "use --host to expose", but
# that doesn't work as you might expect
npm run dev --host

# instead, we need to fix the command with one more thing
npm run dev -- --host

# we looked at todo/index.html, but did not make any changes. You can see that
# it calls src/main.jsx. We also didn't edit that file, but we made or edited
# every other file in that directory
